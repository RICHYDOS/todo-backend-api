# Todo App

This is a web app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate into the project directory: `todo-backend-api/client`.
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Create a `.env` file and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API` variable to the base url of the backend API.
5. Run the development server:
